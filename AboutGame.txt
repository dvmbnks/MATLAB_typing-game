ABOUT GAME:

I have made a typing testing game. Where you type the words or sentences displayed and collect points. 
The game then eventually tells you your words per min and your accuracy. 

There are 2 different modes.
There is also the instructions on the side on how to play.
Tells you your correct letters.
Tells you your incorrect letters.


Key Features:
The words that are displayed are from an excel file that contains thousands of wards. 
- The words are Randomly displayed words by turning excell cells into a vector And the index for the vector is randomly generated which then returns the word and is displayed. 
- Can press enter or select enter.
- 60 Second timer, after that the user input is no longer accepted. 
- Bar Charts that show results after playing at least one round. 
- Easy Mode just displays random words. 
- Hard Mode creates 6 word sentences where the first letter is Capital and there is a period at the end. 
- Accuracy is tested by seeing how many inputs you have and how many you get correct. 
- You can play the game as many times as you wish. 



NOTE:
Typ.m file name could not be changed as MATLAB GUIDE causes issues if done so.
