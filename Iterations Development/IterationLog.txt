Version 1:
	This program is complete backbones of the project. It lays the most fundamental foundations such as Timer, Checking if the words are the same (From input and output). 
Version 2:
	In version 2, the primary difference from Version 1 is that there is a GUI that is created. 
	There are 2 buttons. One of which start the game. The other to press the input of the user.  
Version 3:
	Iteration 3 differs from Iteration 2 as these features are added:
	- Timer is shown in the GUI
	- Enter Key can be used (char(13)) to input user's data so they don't have to press ENTER button on the GUI to register their input. 
	- Colours are added and made more efficent. 
Version 4:
	- The GUI changed signifcantly.
	- There is an image that displays how to play the game. 
	- Randomly generates UPPER CASE WORDS
Version 5:
	- Timer Added on the GUI
	- Game can be restarted. 
Version 6:
	- End SCREEN. 
	- Only GUI Updates. 
Version 7:
	In this iteration, the most signifcant jump happens.
	The correct letters and incorrect letters are displayed in the GUI
	The GUI looks identical but this is a signifcant difference and is a completely new feature. 
Version 8:
	This iteration differs from previous as:
	- In this the letters that you get correct are also present
	- The number of mistakes you make is also present
	- The game mode can also be selected
Version 9:
	In this Iteration The number of games played is shown. 
	There is a msgbox that shows the WPM and Accuracy
	A bit of the GUI is changed around for clarity in looks. 
Version 10:
	- In this iteration, an external storing data is added to create WPM and ACCURACY vectors. 
	- In this iteration, another button is added that calls another function that shows a bar graph with User's performance. 
	- Multiple games can be played by the user whilst having their data stored. 
Final:
The main test in Iteration 10 is to test the new plotResult function as that's the key difference. 
This can be seen in the Driver File that is stored in Iteration 10 Folder.
