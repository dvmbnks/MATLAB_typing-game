Iteration 1:

Testing when the user input is correct to Word. 
Word		Input (User)         Output(Matlab)       Expected Output
immigration	immigration				1				  1
younger		younger 				2				  2
youth		youth					3				  3

Testing when the user gets it completely wrong
Word		Input (User)         Output(Matlab)     Expected Output
immigration	zero				0				 	0
younger		young 				0				 	0
youth		zoom				0				  	0

Testing when the user writes the word in the wrong capitialisation
Word		Input (User)        Output(Matlab)     Expected Output
immigration	IMMIGRATION			0	                0
younger		YOUNGER 			0	                0
youth		YOUTH				0	                0


In all the cases  (Score is the output) and assume that the same case has occured throughout the 60 seconds as there is a timer. 

							Iteration 2:

Testing if ENTER Button on GUI works when the user input is correct to Word. 
Word		Input (User)        Output(Matlab)       Expected Output
immigration	immigration			1				     1
younger		younger 			2				     2
youth		youth				3				     3

Testing if ENTER Button on GUI works when the user gets it completely wrong
Word		Input (User)         Output(Matlab)     Expected Output
immigration	zero				0				 	0
younger		young 				0				 	0
youth		zoom				0				  	0

Testing if ENTER Button on GUI works when the user writes the word in the wrong capitialisation
Word		Input (User)        Output(Matlab)     Expected Output
immigration	IMMIGRATION			0	                0
younger		YOUNGER 			0	                0
youth		YOUTH				0	                0


In all the cases  (Score is the output) and assume that the same case has occured throughout the 60 seconds as there is a timer. 
Note: Testing is identical between Iteration 1 and 2. 

							Iteration 3:

Testing to Press ENTER (from keyboard not Button) to ensure that it works with Correct Values.
Word		Input (User)        Output(Matlab GUIDE)      Expected Output
because		because				1				   		  1
other		other 				2				     	  2
xi			xi					3				          3

Testing to Press ENTER (from keyboard not Button) to ensure that it works with Incorrect Values.
Word		Input (User)         Output(Matlab GUIDE)   Expected Output
windows		zero				0				 		0
torture		young 				0				 		0
that		zoom				0				  		0

Testing to Press ENTER (from keyboard not Button) when the user writes the word with a Capital instead.
Word		Input (User)        Output(Matlab GUIDE)     Expected Output
immigration	Immigration			0	               		 0
younger		Younger				0	                	 0
youth		Youth				0	                	 0


In all the cases  (Score is the output) and assume that the same case has occured throughout the 60 seconds as there is a timer. 

							Iteration 4:
SAME AS Iteration 3; 

							Iteration 5:
	In this, there isn't much to test as its pretty similar to previous version. All that can be tested is to ensrue that the timer 
	is being reduced on the GUI per second. Which it does. Hence there isn't any input/output that needs to be assessed. 
Iteration 6:
	[NOTHING TO BE TESTED AS GUI is the only signifcant changes]
	
							Iteration 7:

Test 1: Testing Correct Letters

Word			Input			Output1 (Correct Letters)  Output2 (Incorrect Letters) 		Output3 (Score) 		Expected Output1 		Expected Output2	Expected Output3
